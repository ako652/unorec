## Overview

UNOREC Private Social and Humanitarian Program at Kumba Principal Prison
Empowering Youths in Difficulty through Education, Reformation, and Transformation.

UNOREC is committed to making a meaningful impact on the lives of youths in difficulty. Our private social and humanitarian program at Kumba Principal Prison focuses on empowering young inmates through education, capacity building, and self-esteem enhancement.

## Program Highlights
In 2015, seven prison inmates from Kumba Principal Prison participated in the National Exams for the First School Leaving Certificate. We are proud to report that all seven inmates successfully passed their exams.

## Program Objectives
# Education: Providing access to quality education to prepare inmates for national exams and future opportunities.
# Reformation: Offering programs aimed at behavioral change and personal growth.
# Transformation: Building capacity and self-esteem to help inmates reintegrate into society as confident and skilled individuals.
## Achievements
# Examination Success: All seven participating inmates passed the First School Leaving Certificate exams in 2015.
# Capacity Building: Through our program, inmates have developed new skills and knowledge that will aid their reintegration into society.
# Self-Esteem Enhancement: By achieving academic success, inmates have experienced a significant boost in self-esteem and confidence.
## Overcoming Financial Challenges
Despite facing a tight budget, UNOREC managed to provide comprehensive support to the inmates:

# Certificate Provision: We ensured that all inmates received their certificates, addressing the lack of access to essential documentation.
# Birth Certificate Registration: Many inmates did not have birth certificates. We took it upon ourselves to register them, facilitating their legal recognition.
# Personal Investment: All expenses, including the registration and provision of necessary documents, were covered out of our own pockets, demonstrating our commitment to the cause



UNOREC remains dedicated to supporting and empowering marginalized communities through targeted educational and reformatory programs. Our work at Kumba Principal Prison is a testament to the positive change that can be achieved through commitment and collaboration.
