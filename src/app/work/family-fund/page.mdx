## Overview

### Summary of the Conflict Outbreak and Its Aftermath

**Ibi jus, ibi remedium** is a Latin legal maxim meaning, "Where there is a right, there is a remedy." Ironically, since 2016, Cameroonian citizens have suffered gross human rights violations without remedy. These violations include killings, arbitrary arrests, illegal detentions, mental and physical torture, human trafficking, prostitution, child labor, modern-day slavery, and infringement on the right to education through the burning of schools.

### Vulnerable Victims
- **Girl Child**
- **Youths in General**
- **Women, Especially Widows**
- **Physically Challenged Individuals**

### How the Crisis Contributed to Human Rights Abuses and Affected Democracy

**Impact on the Girl Child:**
- The crisis has disrupted their education, forcing many into early marriages as desperate parents try to cope.
- It is common to see girls aged 13 to 15 married to older men. Some are even used as payment for their parents' debts.

**Effect on Internally Displaced Families:**
- Displaced parents who migrated to cities struggle with high living costs and lack of skills, sending young girls to hawk goods to make ends meet. This exposes them to child labor, rape, and molestation.

**Destruction of Education and Public Institutions:**
- Since 2016, fighters have set schools and public institutions on fire, causing looting, killings, abductions, and widespread destruction. Youths have lost their educational opportunities, and many have become suspects due to the chaotic environment.

**High Male Death Rate:**
- Both sides of the conflict have targeted men, leaving many women widowed and without support. Some widows are expelled by their in-laws, losing all marital property due to outdated customs that treat women as chattel.

**Physical Disabilities:**
- The conflict has left many breadwinners permanently disabled, with men, women, and children now requiring special assistance.

### Common Human Rights Abuses and Our Interventions

**Human Rights Abuses:**
- **Children and Youth:** Facing child labor, forced marriages, and lack of education.
- **Women:** Suffering from sexual abuse, displacement, and loss of property rights.
- **General Population:** Arbitrary arrests, torture, and inhumane prison conditions.

### Our Actions and Successes

**Empowering and Protecting Vulnerable Groups:**
- **Education and Vocational Training:** We have helped many girls and young women, taking them out of exploitative situations and enrolling them in educational and vocational training programs.
- **Legal Assistance:** We offer free legal services to those who cannot afford them, especially targeting internally displaced persons and unjustly detained inmates.
- **Awareness Campaigns:** We raise awareness about human rights through media, ensuring that people know their rights and responsibilities.
- **Pro Bono Services:** We extend free legal aid to anyone facing human rights violations.

**Success Rate with Low Budget:**
- Despite a limited budget, we have successfully registered inmates for exams, provided necessary documentation like birth certificates, and supported internally displaced persons. All expenses were covered out of our own pockets, demonstrating our dedication and impact.

### Proposed Way Forward

**Funding and Empowerment:**
- The funds requested will be used to continue protecting and empowering individuals, promoting democracy, and ensuring respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.
- **Empowering Women:** By providing financial independence, we aim to combat child labor and discrimination.
- **Media Sensitization:** We will increase awareness about human rights through TV shows and social media.
