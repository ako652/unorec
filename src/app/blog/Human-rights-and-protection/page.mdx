These efforts are supported by charitable organizations worldwide to benefit the poor.

### Addressing Children's and Women's Rights in Africa

In Africa, children constitute nearly half of the population, yet awareness of their rights is limited, especially in conflict-affected regions where they endure exploitation, forced labor, and disrupted education. UNOREC is dedicated to safeguarding children's rights by addressing underlying causes of violations, developing strategies, and advocating through public awareness campaigns and legal aid. Similarly, African women face entrenched gender-based discrimination perpetuated by outdated laws and cultural norms. UNOREC actively promotes women's rights by empowering women, challenging harmful practices, and collaborating with community leaders to advance gender equality. These efforts strive to foster a more equitable and just society for both children and women in Africa.
